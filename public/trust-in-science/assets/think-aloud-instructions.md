# Think-Aloud Instructions

In the next sections, you will view scientific visualizations. As you look at each one, please **think aloud** — say everything that comes to mind as you examine the visualization.

For example, you might say things like:
- *"I see a line chart showing temperatures over time..."*
- *"The y-axis label is confusing to me..."*
- *"I trust this data because it comes from a government source..."*
- *"I'm not sure if this visualization is trying to mislead me..."*

There are no right or wrong things to say. We are interested in your natural thought process.

**Your audio will be recorded during the visualization sections.** Please make sure your microphone is working before continuing.
